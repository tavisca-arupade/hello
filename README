This is the Hello World example from the git tutorial
(Changed in original and pushed to shared)

################################################################

This the first repository that I created. In this I added the hello.rb file in which imade changes, staged them and committed them.
I also created aliases in my config file and used them here for executing the commands.
I created new branch "greet: and also tagged various commits to identify them.
Adding structure to repo is done (lib file).
Creating new branches, viewing the graph, resolving conflicts and rebasing vs merging id done.
